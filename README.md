# Netflix_SQL_Project
This project focuses on analyzing a Netflix dataset using advanced SQL queries to extract meaningful business insights. It was completed as part of my internship task for Social Media Analytics.


## üìÅ Dataset Used

- Fields include: `show_id`, `type`, `title`, `director`, `cast`, `country`, `date_added`, `release_year`, `rating`, `duration`, `listed_in`, `description`.

## üß† Project Objectives

- Analyze distribution of Movies vs TV Shows.
- Identify most common ratings and popular genres.
- Discover country-wise content trends.
- Extract useful insights on cast, directors, and release patterns.
- Use SQL to solve 15 real-world business problems.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies
